# Large datasets or temporary files you might not want to commit
# If your feedback.csv gets very large, you might add it here.
# For now, we are committing 'data/' and 'artifacts/' so don't uncomment these.
# data/
# artifacts/

# NOTE ON ARTIFACTS: For a small demo project, committing artifacts/*.joblib
# is usually fine. If your models become very large (hundreds of MBs/GBs),
# you would use a separate system like DVC (Data Version Control)
# instead of Git for tracking them, and then add artifacts/ to .gitignore.
# For this project, it's okay for them to be committed.
